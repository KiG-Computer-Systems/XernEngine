## Philosophy

XernEngine follows a **code-first** approach similar to libGDX:

- **No visual editor** - Everything is done through code
- **Manual rendering** - You control exactly what gets drawn
- **Full control** - Direct access to all engine internals
- **Learn by doing** - Best way to understand game development

This approach gives you complete control over your game and helps you understand how game engines work at a fundamental level.
